# asl-eslint-common
extended asl eslint configuration


# History
ASPeL is consuming eslint from X ASL dev, there was a preference applied by the previous dev. However it may not be inline with HO standards. The old eslint config was also provided by a git repo and HO control was almost no existential. Therefore this new space is the beginning of ASL.  
OLD repo: https://github.com/lennym/eslint-config-lennym

# Usage
To start with no change as keeping the historic rules.
