# History
ASPeL is consuming eslint from X ASL dev, there was a preference applied by the previous dev. However it may not be inline with HO standards. The old eslint config was also provided by a git repo and HO control was almost no existential. Therefore this new space is the beginning of ASL.

# Usage
